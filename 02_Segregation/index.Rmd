# Cellular Automata

- agents $\equiv$ cells, arranged on a predefined lattice
- formal structure of Cellular Automata
  - finite or infinite grid of identical cells $i=1,...,L$
  - cell with internal state $\theta_{i} (t) \in \{\theta_1,\dots, \theta_n \}$
  - neighborhood configuration: $\beta_{i}(t)\in\{\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_m\}$ 
  - discrete dynamics for the state variable at $t+1$ :
    $$\theta_{i}(t+1)=\mathbf{F}\left[\underline{\theta}(t),\underline{\beta}(t)\right]$$
- characteristics: 
  - discrete space, time, and states
  - same transition rule applies to all cells
  - *each* cell is an agent (!)

---


# Cellspace and Neighbourhoods
- Many types of neighbourhoods possible.
- Examples in 2D:
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=800, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/neigh.png")
```
- Finite cellspace L $\rightarrow$ border cells need different update rule
  - option 1: mirror border cells 
  - option 2: periodic boundary condition: A Torus
- Not only squares, but also triangular, hexagonal and even irregular tilings possible (e.g. Voronoi tesselations)

# Conway's Game of Life

- History
  - **John Conway** (1970): design a self-replicating system 
  - 2010: first self-replicating structure in *Life*, called *Gemini*
  - 2013: first replicator that creates a bigger copy of itself (self-similarity)
- Rules of the Game
  - 2D rectangular infinite grid with "dead" and "alive" cells
  - a dead cell becomes alive if 3 neighbours are alive - **reproduction**
  - an alive cell dies if less than 2 neighbours are alive - **underpopulation**
  - an alive cell dies if more than 3 neighbours  are alive - **overcrowding**
- Importance of Conway's Game of Life
  - complex behaviour emerges from simple rules for agents
  - early modeling of self-organization

#Simulating the Game of Life

Dead cells are white, alive cells are black:

```

#Evolution of structures

- still lifes: static patterns (e.g. 'beehive')

- oscillators: repeating patterns

- spaceships: translating patterns (e.g. 'glider')

- guns: stationary patterns which emit spaceships

- puffers: translating patterns which leave a trail of debris behind

- the Gemini replicator: http://youtu.be/A8B5MbHPlH0
 
A whole library of structures is available at https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon

# Urban segregation: definition

Urban segregation is the unequal distribution of different social groups in the urban space, based mainly on occupation, income and education, as well as on gender and ethnicity. -- [The Future of Cities. European Research Comission](https://urban.jrc.ec.europa.eu/thefutureofcities/social-segregation#the-chapter)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1000, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Berlin.jpeg")
```

---

## Segregation example: District of Columbia, US

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=950, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/DC.png")
```

[America is more diverse than ever â€” but still segregated. The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/segregation-us-cities/)

## Questions about the origin of segregation

- Top-down segregation: Discriminatory policies

- Bottom-up segregation: Individual location choices influenced by:
  - Price of housing and services
  - Access to religious centers and education in a language
  - Tenant exclusion and bias
  
- What is the role of inhabitant intolerance to different neighbors?

- Without central discrimination, can segregation emerge even when individuals tolerate living in a neighborhood in which they are in the minority?

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}

]

.pull-right[

- Agents of two kinds, similar number (here 22 and 23)
- Low but nonzero fraction of empty cells (here 19)
- Cells have a neighborhood of 8 cells (3x3 - 1)
- Border and corner cells have smaller neighborhood
- Agents are aware of the fraction of similar agents in their neighborhood: $f$
- Agents are satisfied with $f \geq F$
- $F$ measures intolerance

- Some variablity in this step:

- Options about jumps:  
a) closest happy free spot  
b) happiest free spot: $max(f)$, even if new $f$ still below $F$

# Measuring segregation: Moran's I


$$\Large I = \frac{M \sum_i \sum_j w_{i,j} (x_i - \bar x) (x_j - \bar x)}{(\sum_i \sum_j w_{i,j}) \sum_i (x_i-\bar x)^2}$$

- $M$: Number of occupied cells
- $w_{i,j}$: adjacency matrix of cells
  - $w_{i,j}=1$ if $i$ is a neighbor of $j$, otherwise $w_{i,j}=0$ 
- $x_i$: color value of occupied cell $i$
  - $x_i=1$ if blue agent in it, $x_i=0$ if red agent in it
  - We only count over occupied cells, ignore empty ones
- $\bar x$: mean value of $x$, i.e. fraction of blue agents
- Also known as spatial autocorrelation

# Segregation versus tolerance

- Moran's I stays low for low F values

- Sharp increase above two neighbors for F

- Substantial segregation for F>0.33

# Summary

- Residential segregation: could it emerge without resource limits or central discrimination/laws?

- Schelling's model of segregation: agents in a lattice that relocate when their neighborhood similarity is below a threshold [(Schelling, 1971)](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/suz/dam/jcr:00000000-68cb-72db-ffff-ffffff8071db/04.02%7B_%7Dschelling%7B_%7D71.pdf)

- Analyzing Schelling's model: Moran's I and iteration over F values
  - Segregation emerges below 0.5, as low as 0.33
[(Hatna &  Benenson, 2012)](https://www.jasss.org/15/1/6.html)

- Other models on lattices: Cellular automata. Conway's Game of Life as one of the first examples of emergence of complex behavior from simple rules

# Quiz

- Is there residential segregation in Vienna? If so, on what attributes?

- What other contexts can have segregation besides the residential case?

- What are the simplifications of Schelling's model?

- How can we take into account weaker correlations at distance larger than 1 in Moran's I?

- How is Schelling's model different to the formulation of cellular automata?
